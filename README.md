## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently parse and structure data from unstructured HTML content.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Employs Playwright for robust scraping of dynamic, JavaScript-rendered websites.
- **Asynchronous Job Processing**: Manages scraping tasks in the background, allowing for a non-blocking user experience.
- **Real-time Job Monitoring**: Provides users with live updates on the status of their scraping jobs.
- **Multi-Page Scraping**: Capable of navigating through pagination to scrape data from multiple pages of a website.
- **Flexible Data Export**: Allows users to export scraped data in both CSV and XLSX formats.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with a modular design that can be scaled to handle a high volume of scraping requests.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure job reliability.

## Architecture & Implementation

### 1. System Architecture and Design

- **Backend**: The backend is a **Flask-based monolithic application** designed for clarity and ease of development. It handles all core logic, including API requests, job queuing, web scraping, AI processing, and database interactions.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is a **single-page application (SPA)** built with standard web technologies. It provides a user-friendly interface for initiating and monitoring scraping jobs.
- **Database**: The application utilizes two main collections in MongoDB: `scraping_jobs` and `export_jobs`, which store information about scraping tasks and data export requests, respectively.

### 2. Data Extraction and Processing Pipeline

The data extraction process follows a multi-stage pipeline:

```mermaid

    A[üë§ User Submits URL] --> B(üí° Job Initiation: 'pending')
    B --> C{üåê Background Thread<br/>(Playwright)}
    C --> D[üìù Raw HTML Extraction]
    D --> E[üßπ HTML-to-Markdown Cleaning]
    E --> F{üß† OpenAI API<br/>(Structured Data Extraction)}
    F --> G(üì¶ Data Validation & Storage<br/>(MongoDB))
    G --> H[‚úÖ Job Status: 'completed']
    C --> I(üöß Error Handling & Retries)
    F --> I
    G --> I
API and Endpoints

The application exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing scraping and export jobs:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/scrape	POST	Initiates a new scraping job.
/status/<job_id>	GET	Retrieves the status of a scraping job.
/export/<job_id>	POST	Creates a request to export data.
/export-status/<export_job_id>	GET	Checks the status of an export job.
/download/<export_job_id>	GET	Downloads the exported file.
Scalability and Performance

The application is designed for scalability through asynchronous processing, horizontal scaling of the Flask application, and the use of a scalable MongoDB database. Future enhancements could include a distributed task queue system like Celery for even greater performance.

Deployment and Monetization
Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for modern cloud deployment using:

Docker containers

Managed cloud hosting services (AWS, GCP, Heroku)

A managed database service (MongoDB Atlas)

A CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

Monetization Model

A freemium subscription model is proposed:

Free tier: Basic features and limited usage.

Premium tiers: Pro and Business versions offering higher limits, advanced features like API access, and dedicated support.
